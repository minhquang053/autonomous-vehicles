Open folder /car

First, we need to create a session for hosting rtsp_server
    $ screen -S rtsp_server

Then, we host the rtsp_server
    $ ./mediamtx

Now we can detach the session by holding CTRL and pressing A then D

After coming back to the main session, we run the program 
    $ python3 main.py

We wait until the program output "Server is listening..."

Now we can run the client side code 
Note that we need to clone the repo from github first
    $ git clone https://github.com/minhquang053/autonomous_vehicle.git 

Open folder /car on the client (aka your current computer)
Run the program with the pi's IP ADDRESS, for example
    $ python3 tcp_client.py 192.168.121.53  

!!! Please do note that when you want to stop, you stop the program on the client side:
click the program and press "q", so that both the client and server code can end gracefully
