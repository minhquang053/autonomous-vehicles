* Required: 
    opencv-python and opencv-contrib-python (if using python)
    opencv and opencv-contrib built from source (if using c++)

* Guide to run:
Open folder /car

First, we need to create a session for hosting rtsp_server
    $ screen -S rtsp_server

Then, we host the rtsp_server
    $ ./mediamtx

Now we can detach the session by holding CTRL and pressing A then D

After coming back to the main session, we run the program 
    $ python3 main.py

We wait until the program output "Server is listening at ..."

Now we can run the client side code 
Note that we need to clone the repo from github first
    $ git clone https://github.com/minhquang053/autonomous_vehicle.git 

Open folder /car on the client (aka your current computer)
Run the program with the pi's IP ADDRESS, for example
    $ python3 tcp_client.py 192.168.121.53  
or run the c++ version
    $ ./tcp_client

!!! Please do note that when you want to stop, you stop the program on the client side:
click the program and press "q", so that both the client and server code can end gracefully
